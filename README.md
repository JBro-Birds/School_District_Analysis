# School_District_Analysis

## Overview of Project
The project is to prepare all standardized test data analysis, reporting, and presentation to provide insights about performance trends and patterns.  These insights are used to inform discussions and strategic decisions at the school and district level.  A new_full_student_data.csv file is being provided that includes student ID, student name, grade, school name, reading score, math score, school type (charter/public) and school budget.  In order to be in sync with the working team a python development environment needs to be created and used throughout the project work.

### Purpose
The purpose of this project is to complete the additional request made by the election board to determine voter turnout for each county, percentage of votes from each county out of the total count, and county with highest turnout.  The results of this county-based information will be included with the customer-based results to provide the customer, and in turn the election board, the requested election analysis needed as part of their election audit.  The data for this additonal request is included in the same elections_result.CSV file that contains the candidate-based data and a similar programming process will be followed using Python and writing the results to the elections_result.txt file.
